**K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation**
This repository contains the solution to Task-02 from Comillas Negras, where the goal is to develop a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

**Project Overview**

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze the purchase patterns of customers and group them into segments using K-means clustering.
These segments will enable the retail store to better understand customer behavior and optimize their marketing strategies.

**Deliverables**

Customer Segmentation: Group customers into clusters based on their purchase behavior.
Visualization: Generate visual representations of the clusters to identify patterns and insights.
Documentation: Provide a comprehensive explanation of the process, including code and results.


**Usage Guide**

Data Preparation: Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and located in the data/ directory.
Configuration: Modify the config.py file to set the number of clusters and other parameters.
Run Clustering: Execute src/main.py to run the K-means algorithm and generate the customer segments.

**Results Summary**
The K-means clustering successfully grouped customers into distinct segments based on their purchase history. 
Visualizations of the clusters reveal insights into customer behavior, such as which groups are more likely to make frequent or high-value purchases.
